Hi everyone! 

My name is Tin, you can call me Chase, it's my nickname. I don't have a distinct personality or life background but I'm still proud of them. To start with some features in my personality, I'm an introvert, however, it doesn't mean that I'm not openminded or energetic. I love breaking the ice up and get new friends but lack of communication skills and confidence sometimes put me in the hard condition to engage with other people. Coding, Writing and Reading are my three most favortie hobbies.
